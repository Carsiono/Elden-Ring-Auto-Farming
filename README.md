# EldenRingAutoFarm
### This is a windows application that will allow you to farm runes while AFK.

## How to use
* Must have the "Sacred Relic Sword" which can be obtained by beating the final boss.
* Must have skill bound to the 3 key on your keyboard(or if you use the sourrce code, you can change which key you would use)
* Definitely recommended that your sword is able to 1 shot the enemies at the "Palace Approach Ledge-Road" farming area, otherwise the map may not be able to be opened, and would cause syncing issues

Must complete the white face quest line or use the teleporter in the "Hidden path to Haligtree" area to get to the "Mohgwyn Dynasty Mausoleum" area.

Once there, active the necessary grace, activate the program, and teleport to the grace with the appropriate weapon selected.

## Notes
If you tab out of the game while the program is doing something, it will stop the auto farm.  This can be disabled but it is recommended that this stays turned on.
